Headmaster：

　　Hello，

　　My name is LiHong. I heard of our school will hold a activity about welcoming exchange students from Canada. I want to let one exchange student come to my home.

　　I want to know the culture about Canada. I think they are very happy to tell me their culture. And I can introduce our culture to them. My parents want to talk with a person who comes from Canada. It’s a good chance for them. So I hope I can invite an exchange student to come to my home.

　　Maybe you will ask me if I have ability to talk with them. I can speak English very well. And my family is rich， so I can make them fell comfortable.

　　I can make school be proud of me！

　　LiHong
